# Mace Backport Mod 
The recent snapshot 24w12a brought us the Mace: a melee weapon that deals additional damage the farther the player falls!

Thus, I decided to program a mod that would allow previous versions to enjoy this weapon as well, falling damage cancelling, enchantments and all!

* Also three new enchantments! (Density, Breach, and the bouncy one)

* Mod comes with balanced and normal editions, check the files for more info.

* Tags forge:mace and minecraft:mace are added to allow for other mods to use the weapon from this mod

* The amount of damage a mace can accumulate from falling is UNLIMITED allowing a single hit from a mace to kill a player wearing full Protection IV netherite armor after falling 15 blocks, and a warden after falling 97 blocks!!
